Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used in Java projects.
It helps developers manage project builds, dependencies, documentation, and deployment in a consistent and automated way.

⚙️ Key Features of Maven

Dependency Management

Maven automatically downloads required JAR files and plugins from a central repository.

You just declare them in a file (called pom.xml).

Example:

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>


Build Lifecycle
Maven provides predefined phases like:

compile → compiles source code

test → runs unit tests

package → creates a JAR/WAR file

install → installs to local repository

deploy → deploys to remote repository

Example:

mvn clean install


Standard Directory Structure
Maven follows a standard layout:

project/
├── src/
│   ├── main/java/        # source code
│   └── test/java/        # test code
├── target/               # output (compiled classes, jars)
└── pom.xml               # project configuration


Project Object Model (POM)

The heart of a Maven project is the pom.xml file.

It defines dependencies, build settings, plugins, and metadata.

🗂️ Repositories

Local Repository: Stored on your computer (~/.m2/repository).

Central Repository: Public repository hosted by Apache.

Remote Repository: Custom repositories (e.g., internal company servers).

🚀 Why Use Maven?

Simplifies dependency management.

Makes builds repeatable and consistent.

Integrates easily with IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, and VS Code.

Works seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

📘 Example Command Workflow
mvn clean compile package


This:

Deletes old build files (clean)

Compiles the source code (compile)

Packages it into a .jar or .war file (package)

Each maven file used to have groupId, artifactId, and versionId.
